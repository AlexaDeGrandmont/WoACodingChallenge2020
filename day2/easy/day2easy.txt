It's the second day of the Week of Awesome! You're talking to Tiffany Lau, the CCSS Director of Inclusion, about when the lounge used to be open and students could hang out and chat about math problems. "We came up with <span class="red"><b>sumtorials</b></span>", Tiffany says. "We used to see how high people could count with them. You see, a <span class="red"><b>sumtorial</b></span> is what you get when you take the factorial of a number, and then sum the digits in the result". Since you don't understand right away, Tiffany sketches it out for you.<br><br>

"n! (read as n factorial) means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1<br>
For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800<br>
Then, if we sum all of the digits in the number 10!, we get 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27<br><br>

"So 27 the <span class="red"><b>sumtorial</b></span> of 10", Tiffany says. "What's the <span class="red"><b>sumtorial</b></span> of 100"
