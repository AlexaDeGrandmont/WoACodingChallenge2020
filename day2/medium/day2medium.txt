Nice! Now that you can count your <span class="red"><b>sumtorials</b></span>, it's time to step it up. You decide to challenge Sarah Ali, the CCSS Communications Officer, to a <span class="red"><b>sumtorials</b></span> battle. You send her the challenge, and a few seconds later, you get a message back from her. "Oh? You're approaching me?"<br><br>

She continues "<span class="red"><b>sumtorials</b></span> are a dead meme. This year is all about the finding the <span class="red"><b>Fevenacci</b></span> of really big numbers. This one is way better, we use way more numbers. We start with a Fibonacci sequence. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:<br><br>

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$<br><br>

To get a <span class="red"><b>Fevenacci</b></span> of a number, you have to sum all of all the even term values up to but not exceeding that number. For example, the Fevenacci of 89 is 2 + 8 + 34 = 44."<br><br>

Sarah continues, "So you think you're so smart? What's the <span class="red"><b>Fevenacci</b></span> of 4 trillion?"
