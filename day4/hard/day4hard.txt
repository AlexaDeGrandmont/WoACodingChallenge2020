Ever since the Tech Talk on hacking yesterday, you have become engrossed by computer security and cryptography. It piqued your interest so much that you spent all night following a rabbit hole of online tutorials on how to become an elite hackerman/hackerwoman. By the morning, you have cracked the code! You learn that RSA encryption is based on the following procedure: <br>
<ul>
<li>Generate two distinct primes $p$ and $q$.</li>
<li>Compute $n=pq$ and $\phi=(p-1)(q-1)$.</li>
<li>Find an integer $e$, $1 < e < \phi$, such that $gcd(e,\phi)=1$.</li>
</ul>
A message in this system is a number in the interval $[0,n-1]$. <br>
A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in the interval $[0,n-1]$). <br>
To encrypt the text, for each message, $m$, $c=m^e \text{mod } n$ is calculated. <br>
<br>
To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate $d$ such that $ed=1 \text{ mod } \phi$, then for each encrypted message, $c$, calculate $m=c^d \text{mod } n$. <br>
<br>
There exist values of e and m such that me mod n=m.
We call messages m for which me mod n=m unconcealed messages.
<br>
An issue when choosing $e$ is that there should not be too many unconcealed messages.
For instance, let $p=19$ and $q=37$. <br>
Then $n=19 \cdot 37=703$ and $\phi=18 \cdot 36=648$. <br>
If we choose $e=181$, then, although $gcd(181,648)=1$, it turns out that all possible messages
$m, (0 \leq m \leq n-1)$, are unconcealed when calculating $m^e \text{mod } n$. <br>
For any valid choice of $e$ there exist some unconcealed messages. <br>
It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum. <br>
<br>
Choose $p=1009$ and $q=3643$.
Find the sum of all values of $e$, $1 < e < \phi(1009,3643)$ and $gcd(e,\phi)=1$, so that the number of unconcealed messages for this value of $e$ is at a minimu
