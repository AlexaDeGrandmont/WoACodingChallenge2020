Consider the following game: <br>

Player 1 has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4. <br>
Player 2 has six six-sided (cubic) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <br>

Player 1 and Player 2 roll their dice and compare totals: the highest total wins. The result is a draw if the totals are equal. <br>

What is the probability that Player 1 beats Player 2? Give your answer rounded to seven decimal places in the form 0.abcdefg. <br>
