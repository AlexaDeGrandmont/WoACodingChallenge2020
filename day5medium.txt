After your 2804 class, you head to Mike's Place with the CCSS Director of Academics and 2804 TA, Alexa de Grandmont. While you're having a drink and some curry, Alexa proposes the following game:<br><br>

Alexa has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4. <br>
You have six six-sided (cubic) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <br><br>

You and Alexa roll your dice and compare totals: the highest total wins. The result is a draw if the totals are equal.<br><br>

What is the probability that Alexa beats you? Give your answer rounded to seven decimal places in the form 0.abcdefg.<br>
