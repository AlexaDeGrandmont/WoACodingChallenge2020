Being an upper year student is tough. The school semester hits hard, leaving not a lot of time for things like editing these questions. In fact, Forest, the CCSS ancient, has so much on his plate, he won't even add story to this one at all! Instead, you can have what Alexa wrote, verbatim. Enjoy some hex lol. Also come to my tech talk today at 2 PM.<br><br>

In the hexadecimal number system numbers are represented using 16 different digits: <br>

$$0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F$$<br> 
The hexadecimal number AF when written in the decimal number system equals 10Ã—16+15=175.<br><br>

In the 3-digit hexadecimal numbers 10A, 1A0, A10, and A01 the digits 0,1 and A are all present.<br>
Like numbers written in base ten we write hexadecimal numbers without leading zeroes.<br><br>

How many hexadecimal numbers containing at most sixteen hexadecimal digits exist with all of the digits 0,1, and A present at least once?<br>
Give your answer as a hexadecimal number.<br><br>

(A, B, C, D, E and F in upper case, without any leading or trailing code that marks the number as hexadecimal and without leading zeroes,<br> e.g. 1A3F and not: 1a3f and not 0x1a3f and not $1A3F and not #1A3F and not 0000001A3F).
