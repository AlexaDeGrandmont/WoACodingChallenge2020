It's Friday! That means it's the last day of the Week of Awesome :( But don't worry, the CCSS has lots of events planned for the rest of the school year! Malcolm Smith, the Director of Social, is stuck doing a long task in Among Us. He needs some help solving it:<br><br>

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,<br><br>

$$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385$$<br><br>

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,<br><br>

$$(1+2+...+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$$<br><br>

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025-385=2640$.<br>
Before the impostors find him all alone in electrical, find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one million natural numbers and the square of the sum.
